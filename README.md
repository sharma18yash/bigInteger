## Big Integer Library
 
Problem Statement: Create a big integer library, similar to the
one available in Java. The library should provide functionalities
to store arbitrarily large integers and perform basic math
operations.
Operations:
# 1. Addition, subtraction, multiplication.
Eg Input:
○ Negative numbers won’t be present in the
intermediate or final output (Eg: No need to consider cases like)
# 2. Exponentiation.
○ Base will be a bigint and exponent will be int
# 3. GCD of two numbers.
# 4. Factorial.
Note: For all the operations, input will be such that the
number of digits in output won’t exceed 3000 digits.
